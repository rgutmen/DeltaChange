## Functionality
This indicator does the difference between the currentCandle Delta and previousCandle Delta. If the difference is higher or lower than the one that at the settings, it will draw a symbol.
## Configuration and explanation
There are four pairs of settings to configure in this indicator, one numeric under "Settings" section, and other under "Drawing".

- Reversals: Useful for entries.
	- From Downtrend to Uptrend: Assuming that a downtrend matchs with negative deltas, if the current candle has a positive delta, it will means that more buyers are participating than in previous candles, which it could means a possible reversal.
		- Negative to positive: It will draw a symbol if delta is higher than this parameter.
		- UpTrend - Negative to positive: Symbol to be drawn below the candle showing possible reversal.
	- From Uptrend to Downtrend: Assuming that an uptrend matchs with positive deltas, if the current candle has a negative delta, it will means that more sellers are participating than in previous candles, which it could means a possible reversal.
